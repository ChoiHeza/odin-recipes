    <p>I experimented with Alfredo sauce until I found a quick, cheap, and easy Alfredo sauce combination â€” the secret ingredient is cream cheese!</p>

    <h2>What is Alfredo Sauce?</h2>

    <p>Alfredo sauce is a creamy pasta sauce that's frequently paired with fettuccine. The iconic dish, fettuccine Alfredo, is an Italian menu staple. According to legend, the dish was invented by a Roman chef named Alfredo di Lelio in the early 1900s. Di Lelio's pregnant wife was struggling to keep any food down, so he tossed pasta in the simple buttery sauce of his own creation. He added fettuccine Alfredo to his restaurant's menu soon after.</p>
